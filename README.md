# Feet-Are-Not-Just-For-Walking

Interaction in Virtual Reality (VR) systems is most often accomplished through standard controller devices. However, considering other forms of input is important in order to study alternative solutions for situations where standard controllers cannot be used or simply because we may want to provide a different user experience. For example, Müller et al. [1] considered using foot-taps as a form of direct and indirect interaction in VR. Feet interactions could have a high potential for smartphone mobile VR where controllers are not always available. Müller et al. [1] considered only feet interactions with semi-circular menus. Other possibilities for foot interaction beyond locomotion are possible, for example: using feet to point to objects inside the 3D environment, using feet to control knobs and sliders, using feet to kick or touch moving 3D objects (e.g., in games), etc.

To achieve this goal, a project was developed in Unity framework using the headset and tracker, both HTC VIVE (Generation. 1), whose function is to use the foot has the main form of interaction.

The component developed concists in 4 parts:
- Attempting to recognize gestures manually
- Gesture recognition using IA
- Development of interactive pedal
- Development of FootMenu

(in each of the parts a test scenario was developed to demonstrate its use)
